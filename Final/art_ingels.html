            Art Ingels was a racecar builder who lived from May 14, 1918 to December 16, 1981.
            In the summber of 1956 he would begin constructing the first Go-Kart in his garage with his neighbor Lou Borelli.
            The first Go-Kart was primitive but Art Ingels was clever. He worked at Kurtis Kraft a company that designs and builds racecars. Since he was an experienced mechanic he needed to to figure out how to keep the vehicle light, fast and most all safe.

          <p class="page-content__card__desc">
            When the fall of 1956 came, he and Lou were ready to test the new contraption. They would hold their first test in the parking lot of the Rose Bowl Stadium. Art and Lou would invite their friends and other racecar enthusists to the test. The test was a success and became an inspiration for others to build their own Go-Karts
            Although the Go-Kart was a success, Kurtis Kraft did not want to build them so Art Ingels and Lou Borelli found their own company called the Ingels & Borelli Kart Company.
