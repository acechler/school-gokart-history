      The first Go-Kart was created by a man named Art Ingels and his neighbor Lou Borelli. It was built in Echo Park, California in Art Ingels garage. Art has had experience in building racecars and he thought it would be an interesting idea to create the smallest racecar. Go-Karting became a local phenomenon in Echo Park, when the first go-kart test occured in the parking lot of the Rose Bowl stadium drawing attention from other local racing enthusists.

      <p class="bottom-container__desc">The low cost of building these go-karts in the late 1950s and early 1960s it allowed for the community to grow quickly. Regulation was needed to keep up. In 1957 the International Kart Federation was founded. The young motorsport found itself growing quickly, with many new go-kart tracks being built, it was difficult for regulation to keep up. The cost of participating in go-kart races was climbing. Eventually the rapid growth of go-karting would start to stagnate in the United States.</p>

      <p class="bottom-container__desc">Since the sport was young and growing extremely quick, with many new go-kart tracks being built, it was difficult for regulation to keep up. The cost of participating in go-kart races was climbing. Eventually the rapid growth of go-karting would start to stagnate in the United States.</p>

      <p class="bottom-container__desc">When it came to Europe the sport retained its growth and would continue to grow in the 1960s and 1970s. Go-Karting would be regulated by a branch of the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) called CIK (Commission Internationale de Karting) or CIK-FIA in Europe.</p>

      <p class="bottom-container__desc">- Currently Go-Kart tracks can be found at racing facilities or even arcades across the United States. Its popularity in the United States is not at the levels it used to be, however it is still going strong in Europe. </p>
